# mealfix
MEALFIX is an online platform that consumers can use to view deals on short-dated products and meals. They can then order directly from our website to have them delivered to their homes.

My team and I created this project for the 2022 Ellehacks Hackathon for the **Scotiabank "Food Insecurity"** theme. This was my teammates and my very first hackathon and we were all very fortunate to have been in a team that cooperated and listened to one another because, in the end, we were able to win **First Place** in the category. as well as get **Interviewed** by Scotiabank about the project for their internal newsletter.
